### Background

We're developing a 2D platformer couch combat game filled with intense action and weapons of the future. Take the role of cybernetic soldiers together with your friends and fight in crazy battles with half a dozen weapons. The game supports everything from two to four players, and difficulty scales based on your skill level, ensuring that gameplay is fun for everyone involved. 

### Project description

The game will be made in Unity with the power of friendship and combined effort. Roles have been assigned to each of the three members, which will greatly aid in the organization of the project's many tasks. We have made a clear and well-defined division into three separate phases of development. These are Core, Polish, and Finalization. We hope to finish all three within the given period of time but are more than satisfied if we are able to complete only the first.

### Organization

We will be working in a team of 3 people, with a project manager, a creative director, and a lead developer.

- Project Manager: [svasim1](https://github.com/svasim1)
  - Ensures that the team follows every necessity of the kanban board while realizing the vision of the final product
- Creative Director: [abbaxeros](https://github.com/abbaxeros)
  - Leads the creation of aesthetic and visual pieces as well as producing the mainframe for the game's artistic trajectory
- Lead Developer: [abb-filgal](https://github.com/abb-filgal)
  - Oversees the majority of backend programming, laying the foundation for the very core of our product

### Time plan

We will be working on the game for about 6 weeks. Our goal is to finish the 'CORE' phase of development by the end of the second week. This will allow for a rough outline of a game, with fully functioning features and gameplay. By the fourth week, our plan is that the 'POLISH' phase also will be complete. At that point, the project will seem no different than a completely finished game, with a working menu and intricately detailed sprites as well as mechanics. By the end of the 6th week, the 'FINALIZATION' phase ought to be finished. If we are able to do so, we will be more than happy to reveal a game reveling in fancy VFX, advanced mechanics, unique gameplay, and various handcrafted maps.

### Risk analysis

| Risk                          | Probability | Impact                         | Action                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Team member gets sick         | High        | Less manpower, missing files   | Upload files to GitHub consistently          |
| Technical issues              | Medium      | Delays, potential loss of work | Use GitHub and maintain a good code practice |
| Lack of communication         | Low         | Misalignment in development    | Weekly progress meetings                     |
| Quality Assurance and Testing | Medium      | Bugs, and gameplay issues      | Test the game regularly, before committing   |
