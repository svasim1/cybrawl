### Background

We're developing a 2D platformer couch combat game filled with intense action and weapons of the future.

### Project description

The game will be made in Unity with the power of friendship and combined effort.

### Organization

We will be working in a team of 3 people, with a project manager, a game planner, and a lead developer.

- Project manager: [svasim1](https://github.com/svasim1)
- Game planner: [abbaxeros](https://github.com/abbaxeros)
- Head developer: [abb-filgal](https://github.com/abb-filgal)

### Time plan

We will be working on the game for about 6 weeks. Our goal is to have a _WORKING_ game by the end of the second week. And then we will be adding more features as time goes on.
